## Section 2 Reflection

1. Regarding the blog posts in Part A, how do you feel about asking questions? Do you tend to ask them too soon, or wait too long, or somewhere in between?
  * I feel like the writer made his point perfectly when he illustrated how it can cause an unnecessary work stoppage when you don’t check your ego at the front door and just ask for help when you need it. I firmly believe in a 15-30 minute timer of not getting anywhere for it to not only be appropriate but imperative that you ask for help.
1. In this section, we removed some of the supports that you had in Section 1. We didn't give the directions for how to run a file in node, and really sent you off to learn about functions by exploring several outside resources. How did that feel? What was uncomfortable about it? How did it support your learning?
  * It felt very natural. I found that some of the resources were better written than others, but when I had an issue with an explanation I just googled for another resource until it made sense (I’m finding that the MDN entry usually does the trick). The change in support here didn’t really feel uncomfortable. It did encourage me to seek more sourcing which strengthened my googling and deductive reasoning skills.
1. What is a conditional statement? Give one example of a daily life conditional. Give one example of where a conditional is probably used in a web application you use.
  * A conditional statement answers either true or false using conditional operators.
  * `console.log("Do I go to work today?", dayOfWeek <= 5);`
  * Messages: If sending to multiple people: ask to name the group. Else: firstName lastName
1. How do you add multiple conditions to an `if` statement? In your own words, explain how to program reads them and determines what to do.
  * You can add multiple conditions to an if statement by adding if else statements. If the first condition is “truthy” it executes the statement associated with that condition, otherwise it continues to the next condition to evaluate it (using an if else statement). If none of the conditions are truthy then it executes the else statement.
1. What tools are available to you, as a developer, if you want to check that TWO conditions are met? Or, if you want to check that 1 of 2 conditions are met, before running a block of code?
  * Are you talking about node/repl/etc or logical operators?
1. What questions do you still have about `if` statements and/or functions?
  * I don’t really have questions about them, but I am eager to get to use them more.
