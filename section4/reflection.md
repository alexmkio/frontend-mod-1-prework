## Section 4 Reflection

1. How different did your workflow feel this week, considering we asked you to follow the Pomodoro technique?
My workflow wasn’t massively affected by the change. I figured something out in one of the first 3 minute breaks which was encouraging, but then it felt like a hassle incorporating Pom with real life. Rather distracting. I’d rather just pay attention to my mind/body.
2. Regarding the work you did around setting intentions in Step 1 of the Pomodoro technique - how did that go? Were you surprised by anything (did you find yourself way more focused than you realized, more distracted that you thought you'd be, estimating times accurately or totally off, etc)?
I used an app to track my time. I wasn’t a big fan of adhering strictly to Pomodoro. I typically take breaks pretty close to Pomodoro timings, but employing it exactly as opposed to when my body/mind felt like it needed it threw me off my game a bit. And then it didn’t work around real life. It didn’t work with the random time that my roommate made lunch for us and then me needing to go run errands only a few hours later.
3. What is an Object, and how is it different from an Array in Javascript?
An Object lets you store *lists* of data that can be referenced by using strings or their indexed position. An array only lets you store *a list* of data that can only be referenced by it’s indexed position.
4. For each set of data, would an array or object be better to store it? Explain your choice.

  * List of all of the students in class: Array, because it’s a single list.
  * List of states and their capitals: Object, because it’s more than one list (of key-value pairs).
  * List of things to pack for vacation: Array, because it’s a single list.
  * Names of all the Instagram accounts I follow: Array, because it’s a single list.
  * List of student names and their cohort: Object, because it’s more than one list (of key-value pairs).
  * Ingredients and amount of each ingredient to bake a cake: Object, because it’s more than one list (of key-value pairs).
  * All my favorite restaurants: Array, because it’s a single list.

5. In this section, we talked about an `transaction item object`. It has keys that represent different properties an bank transaction would have, and values that store the data. In a banking app, this data would eventually be displayed in the browser for the user. Think of another Object in a web application that you use frequently. What is it? What keys might be on it? What are example values? 
  * HourlyForcast
  * locationZIP = “32601” (string)
  * timestamp24H = “02/20/2021 14:00” (string)
  * tempF = 70 (int)
  * humidityPercent = 42 (int)
  * wind = “SW 4” (string)
  * chancePercipitation = 0 (int)
  * overall = “cloudy” (string)
6. What questions do you still have about classes and/or Objects?
  * Not many questions about classes and/or Objects but holy cow did running methods with Objects really throw me this time. There were a couple times I was lost as to how to achieve the thing I was asked to do and could not Google may way out of it.
