## Section 3 Reflection

1. What are two points from the Growth Mindset article and/or video that either resonated with you, or were brand new to you?
  * I really appreciated Carmen’s outlook on how challenge ‘isn’t indicative of a deficiency but an opportunity to learn something new’ and how she normalized having bad days.
2. In which ways do you currently demonstrate a Growth Mindset? In which ways do you _not_?
  * I do like to figure out how things work, but I’m not great at establishing and sticking to timelines to achieve a thing *outside of* my professional work. I do know when and how to ask for assistance, and how to analyze and refine the process of learning.
3. Think of a web or mobile application you use regularly. Where is an example of a place that the developers probably use Arrays? Explain.
  * `var phoneContacts = [“person1”, “person2”, “person3”, …]`
4. In your own words, explain what an Array method is.
  * An array method performs an action on an array.
5. What is the purpose of a loop? When we would use a loop in conjunction with array vs. without?
  * The purpose is to reduce a *repetitive* task down to simple code. To run an incrementing or decrementing expression from an initial expression until the condition expression is false and terminates the loop.
  * A loop w/o an array lacks personality. We would use a loop w/o an array to perform a function a number of times or to create a list of numbers. Low-level. 
  * Using arrays with loops allow us to create an indexed list of things with identity: a specific string (ex: name), a specific int (ex: age), etc(?). We would use an array with a loop to perform a repetitive task in regards to a high-level list.
6. If you had to teach a 5 year old about loops, how would you explain it?
  * When we put episode 2 of StoryBots on repeat until bedtime that is a loop.
7. What questions do you still have about Arrays and loops?
  * Nothing much for now. Really excited to see what more I can do with these combined with if/else statements and everything else I’m learning.
