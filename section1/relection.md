## Section 1 Reflection

1. How did the SuperLearner Article resonate with you? What from this list do you already do? Want to start doing or do more of? Is there anything not on this list, that you would add to it?
  * Well, the success rate for immediately explaining a subject to someone else or using it was shocking and I intend on making this a habit of mine. I’m also really happy to hear that some of my favorite foods help slow cognitive decline. I kind of assumed 1 -3, but only personally identify with #2. I’ve only started to really hear about #6 since I’ve started with Turing and I’m interested to see if it works for me. I don’t know that I’d consider myself a “SuperLearner” so not sure I have any personal insight here. I know I’m going to like to take notes, make flash cards… anything I can do to write certain things down physically.
2. What are the data types you learned about in this section? In your own words, define each.
  1. Numbers: all numbers (including negative numbers and decimals). Large numbers are written without commas, and decimals are written with a leading 0.
  1. Strings: any kind of “text” (letters, numbers, special characters, etc). Must be wrapped within consistent single or double quotes.
  1. Boolean: can be answered either true or false
3. How would you log the string `"Hello World!"` to the console?
  * `console.log("Hello World!");`
4. What is/are the character(s) you would use to indicate comments in a JavaScript file? What is the purpose of a code comment?
  * `“// “ or “/* … */”`
  * Comments allow us to add information for other developers in our code in our written/spoken language, as well as let us de-activate parts of our code that we want to temporarily keep from running.
5. In your own words, what is a variable? How would you explain it to a 5 year old?
  * A variable is a name for something that has a certain value. Dear 5 year old, a variable is something for which you can describe. There are how many StoryBots? What colors are they? What are their names? What is their group called? Who is your favorite? Your answers are values to variables.
6. Think of a site or app you use frequently. What are three variables that are probably used? Which data type would each of those variables probably hold?
  * Messages app
  * recipientNumber	string
  * recipientName	string
  * message 		string
7. In your own words, explain what concatenation is.
  * The ability to join together various variables into a string converting each original variable type into string type in the process. Uses “ + “
8. Think of a site or app you use frequently. Where do you think the developers used concatention?
  * Messages: recipientName = “firstName + lastName”
9. What questions do you still have about the work we've done so far? (not having a question is not an option)
  * Is there a process for me to be able to communicate typos I find in the original branch of these turing materials? Does it have something to do with the issue tracker?
